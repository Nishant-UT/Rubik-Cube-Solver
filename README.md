# ðŸ§  Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver using BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA* (Korfâ€™s Algorithm)

A complete **3x3 Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver** implemented in **Python**, using advanced search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)**, and **Korfâ€™s IDA\*** (Iterative Deepening A*) algorithm.

Includes a **real-time GUI** to visualize and benchmark the performance of each algorithm on scrambled cube states.
